# Overview
This repository contains the design files and code for a train pantograph created using Arduino, laser cutting techniques, and SolidWorks. The pantograph is a crucial component for electric trains, enabling them to draw power from overhead lines efficiently.


# Features
Arduino Control: Utilizes Arduino microcontrollers for precise control of pantograph movements.
Laser-Cut Components: Design incorporates laser-cut parts for lightweight and durable construction.
SolidWorks Design: Detailed 3D models and simulations created in SolidWorks to ensure functionality and reliability.
Automatic Adjustment: Implements sensors and actuators for automatic height and angle adjustments based on overhead line conditions.
Safety Considerations: Focus on safety with fail-safe mechanisms and real-time monitoring of pantograph conditions.

# Files
SolidWorks Files: Includes CAD files (pantograph.SLDPRT, pantograph.SLDASM) for the 3D model and assembly of the pantograph.
